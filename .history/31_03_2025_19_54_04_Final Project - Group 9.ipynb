As a result, there is potential for their experience level to be exagerated. The other variables also have potential to be innacurately reported as players could potentially lie about their age or input a gender that they do not actually identify with."

    "To answer the research question, a classifier will be constructed and it will be determined if it is more accurate than simply guessing whether or not someone is subscribed to a newsletter. We can see from the summary of the dataset that there were 144 TRUE responses and 52 false responses. If one were to guess TRUE for every response, they would have an accuracy of 144/196 or 73%. For this classifier to be useful and to prove that age and time played can predict whether or not an individual subscribes to a newsletter, it must have an accuracy greater than 73%.\n",

    "A potential limitation of this method is the gaps in collected data for the predictor variables. The majority of the data collected is from players aged 10 to 30 who played under 50 hours. The classifier could potentially have trouble predicting a class for data that falls outside this range as it will not encounter such values as often while being trained.\n",

    "To build the classifier, the data being analyzed must first be split into a training set and a test set. The data will be split with 75% of it going into the training set, and 25% into the test set. The training set is used to construct the classifier, which is then used to predict the class of different observations from the test set. Cross validation will be used to select the most accurate k value based on the dataset. Then, the accuracy of the classifier must be tested. To do so, a confusion matrix is generated which provides the values for the total number of correct classifications as well as the total number of all classifications. The metrics of this confusion matrix will then be determined and its accuracy will be calculated. This will give us the accuracy of the classifier. This accuracy value can be compared with the accuracy of just guessing (73%), and it will be determined whether or not the classifier is accurate enough to be deemed useful."
